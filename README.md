## About Me
Hello there! I'm a Master of Molecular Science and Software Engineering student at UC Berkeley with excellent analytical and problem solving skills looking to develop a career in software engineering. I graduated Summa Cum Laude and with Departmental Highest Honors from UCLA with a Bachelor of Science in Chemistry and a minor in Bioinformatics. As a researcher, graphic designer, and tutor, I have developed strong communication and technical skills as well as both the ability and the drive to learn anything I need to quickly. 

## Relevant skills

- Object-oriented analysis and design
- C++, Microsoft Visual Studio
- Python, Pycharm, Jupyter Notebook
- Experience working in a Linux environment
- Excellent analytical and problem solving skills
- Graphic Design and animation using AdobePhotoshop, Illustrator, and After Effects

## My Projects

### Viral Protein Molecular Modeling Database
This project implements a user interface to facilitate the access of data from high end simulations for drug discovery. It was completed as my capstone project for the MSSE program. The code is hosted here:
<https://github.com/cmshuang/mmdb>. You can find the written project report [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1W8aOzEwMj1O0SpJl2HDed4VjdTXjJbHM/view?usp=sharing) and the presentation slides [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OIen_-eMTmh47GV-j4gak6SaaPLye3lW/view?usp=sharing).

### Geometry Optimization with CNDO/2 Molecular Orbital Calculation
This project implements an object-oriented approach to the calculation of electronic energy and molecular orbitals using the CNDO/2 method. Geometry optimization using steepest descent and BFGS is also implemented. See the results [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1R2zNA07_R5sGV9tnZaznp1QoimdUUQxt/view?usp=sharing) and the repository here: <https://github.com/cmshuang/cndo_2>. 

### Video Game Genre Classification
This project follows big data paradigms to attempt classification of video game genre from global sales data, game platform, and ESRB content. The process includes data scraping, cleaning and preparation, exploratory data analysis, principal components analysis, and random forest classification. The code, cleaned data, and written report are hosted on this repository: <https://github.com/cmshuang/game_genre_classifiction>
